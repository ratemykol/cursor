# Render Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Your Render deployment is failing because:
- Build creates `dist/production.js` (correct)
- But start command looks for `dist/index.js` (incorrect)

## Fix in Render Dashboard

1. **Go to your Render Web Service settings**
2. **Update the Start Command to**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production node dist/production.js
   ```

## Required Environment Variables in Render

Make sure these are set in your Render environment:
- `DATABASE_URL` = `[your internal Render database URL]` 
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`

## Build Command (should already be correct)
```
npm install && npm run build && esbuild server/production.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/production.js
```

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `dist/production.js` - Production server (58.5kb)
- ✅ `dist/public/` - Frontend assets
- ✅ Database synced with 45 traders + admin user

## What Changed
- Using dedicated production server (`server/production.ts`)
- Removed Vite dependencies from production
- Simplified CORS and security for deployment
- Proper static file serving without development tools
