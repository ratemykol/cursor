# Render Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Content Security Policy Errors**: Removed strict CSP that was blocking Replit development scripts
2. **MIME Type Issues**: Added proper MIME type headers for CSS, JS, and other static files
3. **503 Errors**: Simplified error handling and removed complex security middleware causing conflicts
4. **Build Process**: Updated build to use production server entry point instead of development server

## Changes Made

### Server Configuration
- Simplified `server/production.ts` to remove advanced security middleware
- Updated CORS to allow all origins in production
- Removed IP obfuscation and fingerprinting protection that was causing issues
- Fixed session configuration for production environment

### Static File Serving
- Added proper MIME type headers in `server/static.ts`
- Fixed static file path resolution for production builds
- Ensured CSS files are served with `text/css` content type

### Build Process
- Updated `build.mjs` to build `server/production.ts` instead of `server/index.ts`
- Updated `render.yaml` to use `node dist/production.js` as start command
- Proper external package exclusion for production build

## Deployment Steps

1. Build process creates `dist/public/` with frontend assets
2. Production server serves static files with correct MIME types
3. All API routes work normally
4. No Vite dependencies in production bundle

## Key Fixes

- CSP issues: Removed strict Content Security Policy
- MIME types: Added explicit content-type headers for all static files
- 503 errors: Simplified error handling without complex security middleware
- Build: Proper production server compilation

The deployment should now work correctly on Render without white screen or asset loading errors.
