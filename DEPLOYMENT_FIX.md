# Production Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
- **Error**: `Cannot find package 'vite' imported from /app/dist/index.js`
- **Root Cause**: Vite was being bundled into production build and imported at runtime

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `server/static.ts`
- Separated static file serving functionality from Vite dependencies
- Moved `log` and `serveStatic` functions here for production use

### 2. Updated `server/index.ts`
- Changed from static import to dynamic import for Vite
- Vite now only loads in development mode: `const { setupVite } = await import("./vite");`
- Uses production-safe static serving in production

### 3. Multi-Stage Dockerfile
- **Build stage**: Installs all dependencies, builds the application
- **Production stage**: Only installs production dependencies, copies built files
- Eliminates Vite from final production image

## Deployment Steps for Render

1. **Push these changes** to your GitHub repository using Replit's version control
2. **Go to Render dashboard** → Your web service
3. **Click "Manual Deploy"** to redeploy with the fixes
4. **Set up PostgreSQL database** if not already done
5. **Add environment variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (from your Render PostgreSQL database)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (any random string for sessions)

## Expected Results
- ✅ Vite dependencies no longer in production build
- ✅ Application starts successfully with `npm start`
- ✅ Static files served correctly from `dist/public`
- ✅ No more module import errors

The application should now deploy successfully on Render without the Vite module error.
