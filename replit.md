# RateMyKOL - Platform Documentation

## Overview

RateMyKOL is a full-stack web application designed as a platform for rating and reviewing KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders). The application uses a modern tech stack with React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database, featuring a shadcn/ui design system for a polished user interface.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure with `/api` prefix
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Production**: esbuild for fast bundling

### Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for production)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless driver for PostgreSQL

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication with username/password
- **Schema Definition**: Located in `shared/schema.ts` with Zod validation
- **Type Safety**: Auto-generated TypeScript types from Drizzle schema

### Authentication System
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with memory and database implementations
- **User Management**: CRUD operations for user entities
- **Session Handling**: Built-in session management capabilities

### UI Component System
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui "new-york" style variant
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive set of accessible components
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties with light/dark mode support
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library

### Development Tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for instant development feedback
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode for type safety

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. **API Requests**: Client uses fetch with credentials for authenticated requests
2. **Query Management**: TanStack Query handles caching, refetching, and state
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications
4. **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between client and server

### State Management
1. **Server State**: Managed by TanStack Query with automatic caching
2. **UI State**: Local React state for component-specific data
3. **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex form management
4. **Global State**: Minimal global state, preferring server state

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Hook Form
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight routing
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with Neon Database driver
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild, tsx for development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration

### UI Enhancement Libraries
- **Animations**: Class Variance Authority for component variants
- **Utilities**: clsx, tailwind-merge for conditional styling
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation
- **Carousel**: Embla Carousel for interactive components

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- **Production**: Compiled JavaScript with Node.js execution
- **Database**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for connection

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: Node.js 20, Web, PostgreSQL 16
- **Port Mapping**: Internal port 5000 mapped to external port 80
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for automatic scaling deployment
