Ok I have 3 errors: 1) Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 Understanding the problem
This error message indicates that the server you are trying to access is currently unavailable. The "503 Service Unavailable" HTTP status code means that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request. This is often due to the server being overloaded, undergoing maintenance, or experiencing a temporary outage [1, 2, 4].

How to verify
You can verify this by trying to access the resource again after a short period. If the server was temporarily overloaded or undergoing maintenance, it might be available later. You can also check the network tab in DevTools to see the specific request that failed and its response headers. The server might include a Retry-After header suggesting when to retry the request [3].

Suggested fix
As a client-side developer, there isn't a code fix you can implement directly to resolve a 503 error on the server side. However, you can:

Inform the server administrator: If you are working with a backend team, inform them about the 503 error so they can investigate the server's status.
Implement retry logic: In your application's code, you can implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed requests after a delay, especially if the server provides a Retry-After header.

Refused to load the script 'https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback. Understanding the problem
This console message indicates that your browser blocked the loading of the script from https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js. This happened because your website's Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents scripts from being loaded from this external domain. The script-src directive in your CSP is set to 'self' 'unsafe-eval', which only allows scripts from the same origin as your website ('self') and permits the use of eval() and similar methods ('unsafe-eval'). Since replit.com is a different domain, the script loading was blocked. The message also mentions that script-src-elem was not explicitly set, so the broader script-src directive was used as a fallback [1, 2, 4].
Suggested fix
To fix this, you need to modify your Content Security Policy to allow scripts from https://replit.com. You can do this by adding https://replit.com to your script-src directive
