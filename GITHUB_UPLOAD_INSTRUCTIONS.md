# Upload Your Code to GitHub - Manual Method

Since the git lock is preventing normal operations, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Download Your Code

1. **In Replit file explorer**, click the **three dots (â‹®)** at the top
2. **Select "Download as ZIP"**
3. **Save the ZIP file** to your computer
4. **Extract/unzip** the downloaded file

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [github.com](https://github.com)** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository name**: `ratemykol`
5. **Description**: `Crypto trader rating platform`
6. **Set to Public** (so Render can access it)
7. **DON'T check** "Add a README file"
8. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 3: Upload Your Files

1. **On your new GitHub repository page**, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. **Drag and drop** all the files from your extracted folder (NOT the .git folder)
3. **Or click "choose your files"** and select all files
4. **Important files to include**:
   - All `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.json` files
   - `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `render.yaml`
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `client/` folder
   - `server/` folder
   - `shared/` folder

## Step 4: Commit the Upload

1. **Add commit message**: `Initial commit - RateMyKOL application`
2. **Click "Commit changes"**

## Step 5: Get Repository URL

Your repository URL will be: `https://github.com/yourusername/ratemykol`

Copy this URL - you'll need it for Render deployment.

## Next Steps

Once uploaded, continue with the Render deployment from `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` starting at Step 2.
