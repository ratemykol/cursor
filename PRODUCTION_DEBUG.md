# Production Debugging Guide

## Issue: Traders not appearing on deployed website

### Current Status
- Local development: API returns 45+ traders successfully
- Production deployment: Website loads but no traders visible
- Database has 45 traders confirmed via SQL

### Potential Issues

1. **Database Connection**: Production may not be connecting to the correct database
2. **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL might not be properly configured on Render
3. **Schema Migration**: Drizzle schema may not be synced with production database
4. **API Endpoint**: Production build may have different API routing

### Debug Steps Added

1. Added database connection logging to production server
2. Added database test query on startup
3. Enhanced error logging for production issues

### Next Steps for User

If the deployment still shows no traders after redeployment:

1. Check Render logs for database connection messages
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure the database contains trader data (may need to re-import)
4. Check if API endpoints are accessible (try visiting /api/traders directly)

### Manual Database Check

If needed, you can manually verify the production database has traders:
- Connect to your Render PostgreSQL database
- Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM traders;`
- If zero, you'll need to re-import the trader data to production database
