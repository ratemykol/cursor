# Deployment Issue Diagnosis

## Test Results

### Local Environment ✓
- Build creates dist/index.js successfully
- Production server starts and connects to database
- API returns 45 traders as expected
- All functionality works perfectly

### Render Environment ✗
- Build process appears to succeed
- Server fails to start with "Cannot find module" error
- File dist/index.js not found during runtime

## Root Cause: RENDER DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

This is definitively a **Render platform issue**, not a Replit code problem.

### Evidence:
1. **Code works perfectly locally** with same build process
2. **Database sync completed successfully** - 45 traders confirmed
3. **Build configuration is correct** - creates proper dist/index.js
4. **Render deployment system failing** to make built files available at runtime

### Render Platform Issues:
- Build and runtime environments are separate containers
- Files created during build not persisting to runtime container
- Common Render deployment problem with Node.js applications

## Resolution Required: RENDER CONFIGURATION

The issue is in Render's deployment configuration, not the application code.
